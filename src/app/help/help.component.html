  <h2>Strategy Explanations</h2>

  <h3>Covered Call</h3>
  <p>
    A covered call is an options strategy where you sell a call option on stock you already own. It allows you to generate income from the premium received, with the potential to sell the stock if it reaches the strike price. This strategy is useful if you expect the stock price to remain stable or increase moderately.

  <h3>Cash-Secured Put</h3>
  <p>
    A cash-secured put involves selling a put option with enough cash on hand to buy the stock if the option is exercised. It allows you to generate income from the premium while potentially buying the stock at a lower price. This strategy is often used if youâ€™re willing to purchase the stock at the strike price.

  <h3>Protective Put</h3>
  <p>
    A protective put is an options strategy where you buy a put option on a stock you already own. It provides downside protection by allowing you to sell the stock at the strike price if its price drops significantly. This strategy is commonly used as insurance to limit potential losses on a stock holding.
